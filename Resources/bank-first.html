  <h3>Senior Personal Banker – Bank First (September '19 – October '21)</h3>
    <p>
      My title and responsibilities shifted from covering insurance to
      working across both lending as well as insurance. This shift came
      after the Lending and Insurance departments merged at Bank First.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Supervising and training employees, which includes conducting
          weekly standups. Establishing and monitoring goals, reporting to
          higher-ups, and managing both internal and external
          stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
          By implementing incentives and promotions, we were able to
          increase overall engagement with our health insurance partner
          among employees and customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Managing campaign engagement with our general insurance
          partner was something I was heavily involved with. To optimize
          the team&#39;s productivity, this required tracking preliminary data,
          locating cross-selling prospects among all of Bank First&#39;s clients,
          and analyzing purchasing patterns.        </li>
        <li>
          Tasked with hiring, onboarding, and bringing new consultants up
          to speed. This included writing job ads and PDs, screening the
          incoming talent, interviewing and conducting reference checks.
          The hiring decision lay between me and my direct manager at the
          time.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>(Senior) Insurance Specialist – Bank First (January '16 – September '19)</h3>
    <p>
      I started as an Insurance Consultant within the Insurance sales
      team but was shortly promoted to Insurance Specialist and then
      Senior Insurance Specialist.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mentoring and training staff using workshops and feedback
          sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintaining and exceeding my individual targets resulting in
          Insurance Consultant of the year whilst leading the team as a
          Senior.
        </li>
        <li>
          Establishing and fostering relationships with external 3 rd party
          insurance suppliers by attending seminars, hosting their
          representatives, orchestrating and facilitating training days.
        </li>
      </ul>
