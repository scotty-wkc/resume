  <h3>
    Senior Recruiter - 
    Robert Half (July '22 - Current)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Working at Robert Half has been a fantastic opportunity for me to
    develop my skills as a recruiter as well as exercise my ability to
    learn on-the-go and be adaptable to new environments. In this role,
    I worked primarily in recruiting for technology, an industry I had no
    prior knowledge of. I quickly learned the basics of the highly
    specialized technology industry while immersing myself fully in a
    fast-paced sales environment. My main duties included using tools
    like LinkedIn Recruiter, Seek Talent and/or inventory recruitment
    through Salesforce to identify top talent and ascertain whether the
    skillsets listed fit with the role requirements.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Through establishing robust and mutually advantageous
        connections with significant stakeholders in my target accounts, I
        successfully secured the participation of numerous sizable
        corporations as purchasers, including Iress, AHPRA, and Viva
        Energy Australia.
      </li>
      <li>
        Engaging and advocating for my candidates to potential
        employers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unpacking job briefs with my clients to identify the underlying
        wants and needs outside of a standard job description.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conducting reference checks, adhering to the clients onboarding
        process and walking the candidate through step-by-step to
        ensure a seamless transition between workplaces and roles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Utilizing recruitment data from Seek and internal systems to
        provide trends and market insights to prospective clients and
        candidates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing client engagement by establishing a ‘plan to
        placement’ allowing me to impact expectations across the board
        and raise placement chances from 15% to &gt;80%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentoring new hires within the technology recruitment team.
      </li>
    </ul>
