  <h3>
    Customer Experience Analyst - Banxa (December '21 - June '22
  </h3>
  <p>
    My experience at Banxa was cut short due to the massive layoffs
    the crypto trading company went through in 2022 as a result of the
    crypto market crash. However, in this time, I gained valuable
    experience around process improvements, project management and
    stakeholder management on a global scale.
    <ul>
      <li>
        An example of process improvement at Banxa can be seen in my
        first task at Banxa, which involved migrating a 100+ page
        document that held key information and processes for our
        worldwide customer-facing teams into comprehensive and user-
        friendly process streams. The end-goal was to construct a KMS
        in Confluence. This included maintaining process modifications
        and teaching over 40 employees how to use the tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the migration, I identified a hole in the initial response time of
        up to three to five working days for client questions. Using
        Confluence, I created a configurable chatbot that communicated
        with all customer-facing online and mobile apps under Banxa&#39;s
        authority. Before connecting to a real customer support agent,
        this bot would respond to enquiries from customers using a series
        of question alternatives. First contact time was cut from up to five
        business days to less than 20 minutes as a result.
      </li>
      <li>
        I assembled a senior representative task force to continue
        refining procedures for an improved customer experience.
        Training them to go through the procedures in Confluence and
        determine how they may be optimized and updated while also
        continuously improving the chatbot.
      </li>
    </ul>
